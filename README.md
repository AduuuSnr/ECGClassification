# QRS detection using K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (KNN) and evaluation on standard ECG databases
## Introduction
The function of human body is frequently associated with signals of electrical, chemical, or acoustic origin. Extracting useful information from these biomedical signals has been found very helpful in explaining and identifying various pathological conditions. The most important are the signals which are originated from the heart's electrical activity. This electrical activity of the human heart, though it is quite low in amplitude (about 1 mV) can be detected on the body surface and recorded as an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. The ECG arise because active tissues within the heart generate electrical currents, which flow most intensively within the heart muscle itself, and with lesser intensity throughout the body. The flow of current creates voltages between the sites on the body surface where the electrodes are placed. The normal ECG signal consists of P, QRS and T waves. The QRS interval is a measure of the total duration of ventricular tissue depolarization. QRS detection provides the fundamental reference for almost all automated ECG analysis algorithms. Before to perform QRS detection, removal or suppresion of noise is required. The aim of this work is to explore the merits of KNN algorithm as an ECG delineator. The KNN method is an instance based learning method that stores all available data points and classifies new data points based on similarity measure. In KNN, the each training data consists of a set of vectors and every vector has its own positive or negative class label, where K represents the number of neighbors.

## Installation and Usage

## MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database
The MIT-BIH Arrhytmia DB contains 48 half-hour excepts of two-channel ambulatory ECG recordings, obtained from 47 subjects studied by the BIH Arrhythmia Laboratory between 1975 and 1979. The recordings were digitized at 360 samples per second per channel with 11-bit resolution over a 10 mV range.
