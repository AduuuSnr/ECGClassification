# QRS detection using K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (KNN) and evaluation on standard ECG databases
The function of human body is frequently associated with signals of electrical, chemical, or acoustic origin. Extracting useful information from these biomedical signals has been found very helpful in explaining and identifying various pathological conditions. The most important are the signals which are originated from the heart's electrical activity. This electrical activity of the human heart, though it is quite low in amplitude (about 1 mV) can be detected on the body surface and recorded as an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. The ECG arise because active tissues within the heart generate electrical currents, which flow most intensively within the heart muscle itself, and with lesser intensity throughout the body. The flow of current creates voltages between the sites on the body surface where the electrodes are placed. The normal ECG signal consists of P, QRS and T waves. The QRS interval is a measure of the total duration of ventricular tissue depolarization. QRS detection provides the fundamental reference for almost all automated ECG analysis algorithms. Before to perform QRS detection, removal or suppresion of noise is required. The aim of this work is to explore the merits of KNN algorithm as an ECG delineator. The KNN method is an instance based learning method that stores all available data points and classifies new data points based on similarity measure. In KNN, the each training data consists of a set of vectors and every vector has its own positive or negative class label, where K represents the number of neighbors.
